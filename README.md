A Java API for modular programming

## DISCLAIMER
I am NOT (yet) a Computer Science expert, nor do I claim that this is accurate to what [Modular Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) is.

## WHY?
I originally decided to create this because, lately, I've been starting to take on larger and larger projects, and I don't exactly have a team of people to help me. Because of this, I've decided to start developing larger projects as modules so I could break up the massive project into many smaller ones that can be reused and swapped for other parts.
